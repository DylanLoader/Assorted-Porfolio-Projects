An assortment of random standalone projects of various types. Here are the projects in no specific order:

- [Traffic Detection App](https://github.com/DylanLoader/Assorted-Porfolio-Projects/tree/main/traffic-detection): A simple app using Roboflow's Supervision library with Ultralytic's YOLOv8  Model to detect and count bidirectional traffic flow from video.
